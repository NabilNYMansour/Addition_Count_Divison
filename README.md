# Addition Counting Division Algorithm
- This is an algorithm made to divide with low level hardware.
- The algorithm utilizes addition counting method to evaluate the division of two integer values
    up to n integers after the decimal points.
- This repository holds the following:
    - .txt files that explain the algorithm.
    - A python file that shows the algorithm in action.
    - A logism file that shows a low_level circuit that utilizes the algorithm to represent a quotient value only.
    - Some .png values that are screenshots of the logism circuit.
